# Analysis-Of-Student-Outcome-in-MOOC

Prediction of Outcome in Massive Open Online Course by making use of 
various Machine Learning classification algorithms. 

# Introduction:
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have the potential to enable free 
university-level education on an enormous scale.Coursera, edX, and Udacity 
offer MOOCs though some are being offered directly by a college or 
university.â€‹ Student interaction with learning activities, such as viewing of
video lectures, undertaking of quizzes, posting in discussion forums, and
interacting with the courseware is captured.Data captured from MOOCs
can provide valuable information for educators by analysing the patterns
present in the behaviour of learners.

# Objective:
A common pattern observed is large early dropout and low completion rate of a particular course. 
Early dropout predictions will provide a framework for developing mechanisms in MOOCs that provide individualized guidance and 
small-group support, 

Increasing retention rates. Thus, an effective way to predict the outcome of a MOOC is needed. 
 
# Scope:
To predict the outcome of user course based on behavioural and 
demographic patterns.
